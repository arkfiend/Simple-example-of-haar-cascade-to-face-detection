# Face detection algorightm with HAAR Cascade

This is a simple machine learning algorithm that 
attempts to identify and plot squares containing 
faces within the "easy" folder. Although its accuracy 
rate is currently at 51%, it's a promising start

* This was made to undersand how haar cascades works

## Requirements to edit / run
* Install python and a lot of AI stuff... OR just [anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/download.html)
* To run, start python enviroment (2.7 pref) and start Main.py file
You may need to edit test.py to specify the correct path to the images
