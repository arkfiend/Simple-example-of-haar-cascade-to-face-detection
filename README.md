# Simple-example-of-haar-cascade-to-face-detection


Simple example testing and trying to detect faces in directory "easy".
Actually this isnt soo good (accuracy +-51%), but still a good example to understand how use haar classifiers.


Sorry for portuguese comments in code.
To run this application, execute Main.py (I suggest by annaconda https://conda.io/docs/download.html)


see ya
